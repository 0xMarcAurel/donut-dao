              <h3>In the beginning...</h3>
              <p>
                A few years ago, when Ethereum was still relatively new in the
                crypto space, a group of Redditors on
                <a
                  href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  ><span class="lp-hyperlink">r/EthTrader</span></a
                >
                had a revolutionary idea. They wanted to take their subreddit, a
                place for Ethereum fans, traders and builders, and make it
                something more than just a place to post memes and talk about
                crypto. They dreamed of a (tokenized) community that could run
                itself, free from the grip of centralized platforms.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's when DONUT was born, a special little token that started
                as an experiment called Subreddit Points (later evolved into
                <a
                  href="https://medium.com/@adamscochran/what-are-reddit-community-points-13e2a839849b"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener noreferrer"
                  ><span class="lp-hyperlink">Reddit Community Points</span></a
                >) in 2019.
              </p>
              <p>
                The concept was simple but way ahead of its time: reward people
                with tokens for posting threads and comments online, and let
                those tokens give users a say in how the community worked. These
                Redditors created a social network where the users, not some
                corporation, called the shots. That's what r/EthTrader was
                aiming for, and DONUT was the key.
              </p>
              <p>
                A man named Carl Larson, the subreddit's top moderator and an
                Ethereum "OG", kicked things off by pushing for a smart contract
                to make DONUT truly decentralized, cutting Reddit out as the
                middleman.
              </p>
              <p>
                The early days were hard. There was criticism about the fact
                that certain people had way too much power and a couple of users
                accumulating a lot of tokens. This eventually led to arguments
                about fairness and control.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the community did not just complain, they rolled up their
                sleeves and got down to business. They thought of ways to fix
                the system, like moving DONUT to an Ethereum smart contract.
                People were learning, failing, and building something together,
                all while Ethereum itself was still figuring out what it could
                be.
              </p>
              <p>
                DONUT was more than a token, it was a proof of concept. It
                showed that the blockchain could support a social space where
                users had real stakes: financial, creative, and even emotional.
                Users could earn Donuts and then use them to vote on subreddit
                rules or tip others. It was a living experiment in
                decentralization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Later on, DONUT evolved. It moved beyond Reddit's walls,
                becoming an actual ERC-20 token users could trade or transfer.
                The r/EthTrader community didn't stop there, they created the
                Donut DAO, a decentralized organization to keep pushing the
                ecosystem's boundaries. They dreamed of mini-games and apps, new
                social platforms, and ways to connect DONUT to other
                communities.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a side project became a blueprint for something
                bigger, a way to combine social networks with the power of the
                blockchain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking back, DONUT was a SocialFi project before SocialFi even
                existed. It paved the way for today's buzzword-filled world of
                decentralized social platforms, proving it's possible to reward
                creativity, share ownership, and build a community.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the story of a bunch of Redditors who dared to dream and
                ended up creating a quiet technological revolution.

              <p>
                DONUT's economy is a balancing act, it was designed to keep the
                ecosystem working while staying sustainable. After many years of
                experimentation, mistakes, and adjustments, the community
                collectively developed a method that keeps things fair and
                functional.
              </p>
              <p>Here's the breakdown of how it all works!</p>
              <h3>Fixed minting schedule</h3>
              <p>
                Every year, the Donut DAO mints 20.88 million Donuts, but only
                when or if the treasury runs out of tokens. Once the new tokens
                are minted and deposited into the treasury, the system locks
                minting for 52 weeks. This cap keeps inflation under control,
                making sure DONUT doesn't flood the market.
              </p>
              <h3>Monthly allocation</h3>
              <p>
                The treasury distributes Donuts every month to support the
                community and its projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                In total, 1,740,000 Donuts are distributed and allocated every
                month:

              <h3>Community treasury</h3>
              <p>
                The Donut DAO treasury is guarded by 11 multisig members. Any
                transaction requires 5 guardians to sign off, thus making Donut
                DAO's funds and operations secure.
              </p>
              <h3>Revenue</h3>
              <p>
                The Donut DAO acquires revenue through subreddit ads, paid in
                DONUT. These sales reintegrate the tokens back into the system,
                giving it a steady income to finance the functioning of the
                economy.
              </p>
              <h3>Deflationary mechanisms</h3>
              <p>
                To prevent DONUT's supply from increasing uncontrollably, the
                community developed methods that burn tokens efficiently.

                >. As such, any undistributed DONUT in a round (month) gets
                burned. If subreddit activity drops, less tokens are
                distributed, which in return increases the burn rate. Less
                participation means higher rewards per user and also a higher
                burn rate. This way, the economy remains sustainable even in
                times of less activity.

                Donuts are the fuel of the r/EthTrader ecosystem. They let users
                own a piece of their favorite community and make it their own.
              </p>
              <p>
                DONUT is a SocialFi token that is way more than just internet
                points. It's a versatile, tradable ERC-20 token that powers a
                small economy both on and off Reddit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Donut DAO is constantly working on new ideas to increase
                DONUT's utility, thus scaling the ecosystem and promoting
                DONUT's adoption.
              </p>
              <p>Here's what DONUT is used for.</p>
              <h3>Transferring</h3>
              <p>
                DONUT can be swapped on exchanges or sent anywhere as an ERC-20
                token, free from Reddit's walls.
              </p>
              <h3>Tipping</h3>
              <p>
                Users can tip posts and comments on r/EthTrader, both on and
                off-chain.
              </p>
              <h3>Buying Special Memberships</h3>
              <p>
                r/EthTrader Special Memberships offer subreddit perks like the
                possibility of posting GIFs and customizing the user flair.
              </p>
              <h3>Voting</h3>
              <p>
                Holders can use their Donuts to vote in weighted polls, shaping
                subreddit rules and DONUT's future.
              </p>
              <h3>Advertising</h3>
              <p>
                Advertisers can spend DONUT to rent the subreddit banner and
                pinned posts and comments. To learn more about advertising on
                r/EthTrader, see

              <h3>Moderating</h3>
              <p>
                After earning and holding a certain amount of Donuts, users gain
                moderation rights on r/EthTrader, allowing them to approve and
                remove submissions.
